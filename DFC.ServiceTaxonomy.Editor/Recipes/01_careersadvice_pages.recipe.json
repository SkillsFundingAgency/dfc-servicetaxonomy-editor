These include:</p>\n    <ul class=\"govuk-list govuk-list--bullet\">\n        <li>having a positive frame of mind and a willingness to try new things</li>\n        <li>being keen to meet new people and making them part of a support network of trusted friends and colleagues</li>\n        <li>knowing who to turn to and having the courage to ask for help and advice</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p class=\"govuk-body-m\">Trying to boost your resilience and build a support network can feel daunting. To help with this you could:</p>\n    <ul class=\"govuk-list govuk-list--bullet\">\n        <li>start a course - even online courses give you the chance to meet and chat with other learners</li>\n        <li>join a local or online interest group</li>\n        <li>take up a new hobby you can do with others</li>\n        <li>join a sports team or do something active </li>\n        <li>stay in regular contact with friends, family and work colleagues</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p class=\"govuk-body-m\">If you’re in school, college or university remember that there are professionals like teachers, mentors and careers advisers who can help you. </p>\n    <p class=\"govuk-body-m\">In the workplace you can draw on the support of a manager or get help from human resources professionals. </p>\n    <p class=\"govuk-body-m\">If you're out of work you could speak to a <a class=\"govuk-link\" href=\"https://gov.uk/moving-from-benefits-to-work\">Jobcentre work coach</a></p>\n</section>\n<p></p><hr class=\"govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--m govuk-section-break--visible\"><p></p>\n<section id=\"experiences\">\n    <h2 class=\"govuk-heading-l\">Learn from your own experiences</h2>\n    <p class=\"govuk-body-m\">When things don’t go as planned it can be a great learning opportunity.

Recruitment consultants can match you to job roles.</p>\n    <p class=\"govuk-body-m\">Agencies are useful for connecting you with jobs that are not advertised online or in the press.

You can contact them by email, phone or visit in person. This gives you the opportunity to make a good impression.</p>\n    <p class=\"govuk-body-m\">If you are going to visit, first make an appointment to speak with the most appropriate person. This may be a supervisor, manager or human resources (HR) officer.</p>\n    <p class=\"govuk-body-m\">Ask the person about potential job opportunities and training schemes. They may also ask you questions, so have some answers prepared and be ready to hand in your CV if they ask for one.</p>\n    <p class=\"govuk-body-m\">You may find that the person you need to speak to is not available or they may even reject your approach. This can be difficult to handle but try not to take it personally, as it may be that they’re simply too busy to see you at that time. You\n        can always try again later.</p>\n</section>\n<p></p><hr class=\"govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--m govuk-section-break--visible\"><p></p>\n<section id=\"industry-magazines-journals\">\n    <h2 class=\"govuk-heading-l\">Industry magazines and journals</h2>\n    <p class=\"govuk-body-m\">You can find advertised jobs in industry journals or trade magazines for your area of work.

There are those where the organiser simply posts vacancies online for you to look at. You'll see information on the employer and details about the jobs on offer.</p>\n    <p class=\"govuk-body-m\">At an interactive fair, the employer is available online to talk about their company and their job vacancies.</p>\n    <p class=\"govuk-body-m\">Some virtual recruitment fairs replicate ‘traditional’ face to face recruitment fairs. They have virtual ‘stalls’ so you can visit employers that interest you. They may also include workshops like <a class=\"govuk-link\" href=\"/careers-advice/cv-sections\">CV writing</a>        and <a class=\"govuk-link\" href=\"/careers-advice/interview-advice\">interview preparation</a>.\n    </p>\n    <hr class=\"govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--m govuk-section-break--visible\">\n    <section id=\"prepare\">\n        <h2 class=\"govuk-heading-l\">Before a virtual job fair</h2>\n        <p class=\"govuk-body-m\">As with any recruitment fair you should prepare beforehand, so that you present yourself in the best light. Before attending a virtual job fair you should:</p>\n        <ul class=\"govuk-list govuk-list--bullet\">\n            <li><a class=\"govuk-link\" href=\"#research\">research the companies</a></li>\n            <li><a class=\"govuk-link\" href=\"#tailor\">tailor your CV</a></li>\n            <li><a class=\"govuk-link\" href=\"#interview\">practise your interview techniques</a></li>\n            <li><a class=\"govuk-link\" href=\"#clothing\">wear appropriate clothing</a></li>\n            <li><a class=\"govuk-link\" href=\"#tech-and-environment\">check your technology and environment</a></li>\n        </ul>\n        <section id=\"research\">\n            <h3 class=\"govuk-heading-m\">Research the companies</h3>\n            <p class=\"govuk-body-m\">Most virtual recruitment fairs publish details of the employers who will be at the event in advance. This gives you an opportunity to look up the companies, plan the ones you want to focus on and find out more about them. </p>\n            <p class=\"govuk-body-m\">Doing some research shows employers that you're interested in them and will set you apart from other candidates.</p>\n        </section>\n        <section id=\"tailor\">\n            <h3 class=\"govuk-heading-m\">Tailor your CV</h3>\n            <p class=\"govuk-body-m\">As part of the virtual recruitment fair, you will be sharing your CV with potential employers. </p>\n            <p class=\"govuk-body-m\">You should <a class=\"govuk-link\" href=\"/careers-advice/cv-sections\">tailor your CV</a> and write a <a class=\"govuk-link\" href=\"/careers-advice/covering-letter\">covering letter</a> for the type of role or particular companies you want to meet\n                with.\n            </p>\n            <p class=\"govuk-body-m\">You may need to upload a personal profile to the virtual fair website. Give as much detail as you would on an application or a <a class=\"govuk-link\" href=\"/careers-advice/create-a-Linkedin-profile\">Linkedin profile</a>.</p>\n            <p class=\"govuk-body-m\">Think about how you will introduce yourself to each employer. It's helpful to have to hand, a short introduction that sums up who you are, what you have to offer and why you are interested in talking to them.</p>\n        </section>\n        <section id=\"interview\">\n            <h3 class=\"govuk-heading-m\">Practise your interview techniques</h3>\n            <p class=\"govuk-body-m\">You will be speaking to many different employers during the fair so you should practise your <a class=\"govuk-link\" href=\"/careers-advice/how-to-do-well-in-video-interviews/\">video interview skills</a> before the event. </p>\n            <p class=\"govuk-body-m\">Interviews can feel intimidating sometimes so you may want to think about <a class=\"govuk-link\" href=\"/careers-advice/top-10-interview-questions\">questions employers may ask you</a>. This preparation could help you feel more confident on the\n                day.\n            </p>\n            <p class=\"govuk-body-m\">You can also use information you have gathered during your research on employers to stand out in a video interview.</p>\n            <div class=\"govuk-inset-text\"><span class=\"govuk-!-font-weight-bold\">Example</span>\n                <p class=\"govuk-body-m\">“I read on your website that you’re committed to reducing environmental waste. Can you tell me more about how the role I’m applying for might help achieve that goal?”</p>\n            </div>\n        </section>\n        <section id=\"clothing\">\n            <h3 class=\"govuk-heading-m\">Wear appropriate clothing</h3>\n            <p class=\"govuk-body-m\">During a virtual recruitment fair, you may speak to employers in a video interview. It will use a service like:</p>\n            <ul class=\"govuk-list govuk-list--bullet\">\n                <li>Skype</li>\n                <li>Microsoft Teams</li>\n                <li>Google hangouts</li>\n                <li>Zoom</li>\n            </ul>\n            <p class=\"govuk-body-m\">Employers will expect you to present a professional image. Remember to wear something smart and look well groomed. They will be looking at you as a potential representative of their organisation so make sure you leave a good impression.</p>\n        </section>\n        <section id=\"tech-and-environment\">\n            <h3 class=\"govuk-heading-m\">Check your technology and environment</h3>\n            <p class=\"govuk-body-m\">Before you join an online recruitment fair, make sure that:</p>\n            <ul class=\"govuk-list govuk-list--bullet\">\n                <li>your internet is working</li>\n                <li>you have charged your battery</li>\n                <li>your microphone and webcam are working</li>\n                <li>your browser is compatible with the virtual fair platform</li>\n            </ul>\n            <p class=\"govuk-body-m\">It's also worth thinking about your environment. Sitting at a desk or a table will make you feel more business-like. If your room is likely to appear on camera, make sure it looks tidy. Sitting in front of a plain wall in good light can be\n                useful.\n            </p>\n        </section>\n    </section>\n    <hr class=\"govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--m govuk-section-break--visible\">\n    <section id=\"take-part\">\n        <h2 class=\"govuk-heading-l\">During a virtual job fair</h2>\n        <p class=\"govuk-body-m\">Spend a few minutes getting used to the layout of the fair online and checking out what other services will be offered as part of the event, you may find things like:</p>\n        <ul class=\"govuk-list govuk-list--bullet\">\n            <li>CV checking</li>\n            <li>careers advice</li>\n            <li>recruitment workshops</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p class=\"govuk-body-m\">During the fair, you should make sure to:</p>\n        <ul class=\"govuk-list govuk-list--bullet\">\n            <li>be polite and formal when approaching employers</li>\n            <li>use your prepared introduction to get you started</li>\n            <li>check your grammar and spelling before clicking send if you're using a messaging system rather than speaking on camera</li>\n            <p class=\"govuk-body-m\">You will meet with a lot of different people, so take notes as you go through to jog your memory after the event. This will help you with any follow up contacts you want to make.\n            </p>\n        </ul>\n    </section>\n    <hr class=\"govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--m govuk-section-break--visible\">\n    <section id=\"after\">\n        <h2 class=\"govuk-heading-l\">After a virtual job fair</h2>\n        <p class=\"govuk-body-m\">You may have found your dream job, a job of potential interest or not found any jobs for you.</p>\n        <p class=\"govuk-body-m\">If you have not found anything to suit you at the fair, you can learn from the experience. Think about whether you need:</p>\n        <ul class=\"govuk-list govuk-list--bullet\">\n            <li>a different type of virtual fair format</li>\n            <li>more or less interaction with people</li>\n            <li>more preparation or research next time</li>\n            <li>to ‘attend’ from a different location</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p class=\"govuk-body-m\">If you have found a potential role and been encouraged to apply, you should:</p>\n        <ul class=\"govuk-list govuk-list--bullet\">\n            <li>follow up with the employer</li>\n            <li>thank them for their time</li>\n            <li>tell them what impressed you about the organisation and why the role stood out to you</li>\n            <li>address any issues you did not have chance to raise during the fair</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p class=\"govuk-body-m\">It will help to keep your name and application at the top of their mind.</p>\n        <p class=\"govuk-body-m\">If there's an opportunity to give feedback to the the event host about your experience, do so. If you enjoyed it and it suited you, make sure you join the organisation's mailing list for future events.

To do this, decide what you want from your network before you start.</p>\n    <p class=\"govuk-body-m\">For instance, are you looking for:</p>\n    <ul class=\"govuk-list govuk-list--bullet\">\n        <li>a job?</li>\n        <li>a change of career?</li>\n        <li>work experience?</li>\n        <li>training or an <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/apply-apprenticeship\" class=\"govuk-link\">apprenticeship</a>?</li>\n        <li>careers advice?</li>\n        <li><a href=\"https://nationalcareers.service.gov.uk/explore-careers\" class=\"govuk-link\">information about what a job is like</a>?</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p class=\"govuk-body-m\">Be clear about what you want from the people you make connections with. The easier you make it for them to help you, the more likely they are to do it.</p>\n    <p class=\"govuk-body-m\">Networking works both ways. Show that you also have something to offer. For example, if you see someone asking for advice, offer to help them if you can. It could be as simple as sending them a link to an article online.</p>\n    <p class=\"govuk-body-m\">Networking can feel intimidating at the start. If you feel nervous or shy, ask the person you’re talking to something about themselves. It takes the pressure off you and shows them that you're interested in them.</p>\n    <p class=\"govuk-body-m\">Top tip: always follow up networking with an action. If you've been given a name to contact about a job - do it. If you offered to give someone else information, make sure you do. If you follow up, it shows people that you’re motivated, confident\n        and keen.</p>\n</section>\n<p></p><hr class=\"govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--m govuk-section-break--visible\"><p></p>\n<section id=\"informal-networking\">\n    <h2 class=\"govuk-heading-l\">Informal networking</h2>\n    <p class=\"govuk-body-m\">Informal networks are people that you know outside of work.

Be positive and tailor your examples to the job description.</p>\n    <p class=\"govuk-body-m\">If your work history is limited, you can use examples from outside of work.

Most take place for around 3 months during the summer holidays. </p>\n    <p class=\"govuk-body-m\">Many are paid opportunities though some are unpaid or only cover the cost of your expenses like travel costs. </p>\n    <p class=\"govuk-body-m\">Companies in a range of sectors offer internship opportunities for 18 year-old school leavers, undergraduates and graduates. </p>\n    <p class=\"govuk-body-m\">There are also <a class=\"govuk-link\" href=\"/careers-advice/options-with-education-health-and-care-plan\">supported internships</a> for young people with special needs or a disability.</p>\n    <p class=\"govuk-body-m\">A virtual internship is one where you work remotely. The benefit is that you don’t have to travel to work. It could make getting experience in a big city a possibility, if the cost of travel and living expenses are a barrier. If you can work\n        around time differences you could even work anywhere in the world.</p>\n    <p class=\"govuk-body-m\">On a virtual internship you'll meet with staff, work together on projects and learn about the organisation online, using tools like email and video conferencing. You may take part in webinars and masterclasses as well as online company social events.</p>\n</section>\n<p></p><hr class=\"govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--m govuk-section-break--visible\"><p></p>\n<section id=\"reasons\">\n    <h2 class=\"govuk-heading-l\">Reasons to do an internship</h2>\n    <p class=\"govuk-body-m\">The aim of an internship is for you to:</p>\n    <ul class=\"govuk-list govuk-list--bullet\">\n        <li>gain work related skills </li>\n        <li>learn about the culture and values of an organisation</li>\n        <li>test out your career ideas</li>\n        <li>start building a professional network</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p class=\"govuk-body-m\">Employers often use internships as a kind of screening process for recruiting to future graduate roles or school leaver schemes. </p>\n    <p class=\"govuk-body-m\">If you make a good impression it can improve your chances of getting a position in the future.

Whatever job you try, you’ll learn more about yourself and working life.

It can help you to gain skills and decide what to do.</p>\n    <hr class=\"govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--m govuk-section-break--visible\">\n    <section id=\"what-it's-for\">\n        <h2 class=\"govuk-heading-l\">Benefits of work experience</h2>\n        <p class=\"govuk-body-m\">Doing work experience gives you the chance to:</p>\n        <ul class=\"govuk-list govuk-list--bullet\">\n            <li>try out your career ideas</li>\n            <li>find out more about what’s involved in a job and see if it’s for you</li>\n            <li>learn <a class=\"govuk-link\" href=\"/careers-advice/ways-to-develop-skills/\">new skills</a> or build on those you already have</li>\n            <li>meet new people and grow your <a href=\"/careers-advice/networking\" class=\"govuk-link\">network of contacts</a></li>\n            <li>boost your confidence</li>\n            <li>get back into a work routine if you’ve been out of work for a while</li>\n            <li>show employers what you can do so they consider you when a job is available</li>\n            <li>identify any <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/reasonable-adjustments-for-disabled-workers\" class=\"govuk-link\">reasonable adjustments</a> you need because of a disability or long-term health condition</li>\n        </ul>\n        <hr class=\"govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--m govuk-section-break--visible\">\n        <section id=\"types\">\n            <h2 class=\"govuk-heading-l\">Types of work experience</h2>\n            <p class=\"govuk-body-m\">There are lots of different ways to get work experience. Some might be more useful or only available at certain points in your education or career. They include:</p>\n            <h3 class=\"govuk-heading-m\">School or college work experience placement</h3>\n            <p class=\"govuk-body-m\">Usually 1 or 2 weeks in year 10, 11 or 12. School or college staff may help to organise it or you might have to fix it up yourself.</p>\n            <h3 class=\"govuk-heading-m\">Placements on work-related courses </h3>\n            <p class=\"govuk-body-m\">Courses like <a href=\"https://tlevels.gov.uk\" class=\"govuk-link\">T-Levels</a>, BTECs and some degrees include work experience as part of the course. It might be one day a week over a few months or full time for a few weeks. You may have a\n                placement officer or tutor who can help you to find work experience during your course.</p>\n            <h3 class=\"govuk-heading-m\">A traineeship </h3>\n            <p class=\"govuk-body-m\">A <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/find-traineeship\" class=\"govuk-link\">traineeship</a> is a course with work experience that gets you ready for work or an apprenticeship.

You could do this to find out about a new job. If you're in a job, you could use it to explore opportunities for personal development or promotion within your company. It gives\n                you an idea of what might be involved in a job rather than hands-on experience.</p>\n            <h3 class=\"govuk-heading-m\">Internships </h3>\n            <p class=\"govuk-body-m\">Paid periods of work experience lasting around 2 to 3 months in the summer. Mostly aimed at undergraduates and newly qualified graduates with some opportunities for school leavers. You can get information from your university careers service.\n                There may be internship schemes dedicated to students at your university.</p>\n            <h3 class=\"govuk-heading-m\">Year placements </h3>\n            <p class=\"govuk-body-m\">This is a paid year in the workplace as part of a higher education course. You apply for these in the same way as graduate jobs. University careers services can help you to find opportunities relevant to your course.</p>\n            <h3 class=\"govuk-heading-m\">Insight events </h3>\n            <p class=\"govuk-body-m\">Usually organised by companies or careers organisations -you spend a day or a few days finding out about a specific sector such as finance, law or IT. It could include networking, career presentations and hands-on activities.</p>\n            <h3 class=\"govuk-heading-m\">Gap year and year abroad experience </h3>\n            <p class=\"govuk-body-m\"><a href=\"/careers-advice/advice-on-a-gap-year\" class=\"govuk-link\">Gap year</a> and work abroad experiences can be organised by commercial organisations and charities or something that you set up for yourself.</p>\n            <h3 class=\"govuk-heading-m\">Virtual work experience </h3>\n            <p class=\"govuk-body-m\">Sites like <a href=\"https://s2sacademy.com/\" class=\"govuk-link\">Accenture's Skills to Succeed Academy</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://barclayslifeskills.com/i-want-virtual-work-experience/school/virtual-work-experience\" class=\"govuk-link\">Barclays Lifeskills</a>                can help you to develop skills to deal with situations in the workplace, without having to go out on a placement. <a href=\"https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/vet-school-application-support\" class=\"govuk-link\">FutureLearn</a> has a virtual\n                work experience course for exploring the work of a vet.

You can test out different jobs to find out what you prefer.</p>\n<p class=\"govuk-body-m\">At 16 or 18 you may not have much work experience to make your CV or personal statement stand out. Volunteering gives you experience and a chance to develop the soft skills that are useful in all careers.\n</p>\n<p class=\"govuk-body-m\">Through volunteering you can:</p>\n<ul class=\"govuk-list govuk-list--bullet\">\n    <li>find out what's involved in a job to see if it's for you</li>\n    <li>try out different career ideas</li>\n    <li>learn new skills or build on ones you already have</li>\n    <li>meet new people and develop your network of contacts</li>\n    <li>boost your confidence</li>\n    <li>give back to your community</li>\n</ul>\n<p></p><hr class=\"govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--m govuk-section-break--visible\"><p></p>\n<section id=\"choose\">\n    <h2 class=\"govuk-heading-l\">How to choose a volunteering position</h2>\n    <p class=\"govuk-body-m\">You may have to take small steps to get to your perfect volunteering opportunity. It can be very competitive and for some opportunities, you might need to be over 18. Be creative about where you'll go and what you're willing to do. This approach can\n        help you gain skills for the long-term.</p>\n    <p class=\"govuk-body-m\">For example, if you want to work with animals, getting into a charity like the RSPCA may be difficult without experience. You could show your commitment by doing something like dog walking or pet sitting for friends and relatives first.</p>\n    <p class=\"govuk-body-m\">Think broadly about how to get into volunteering, like:</p>\n    <ul class=\"govuk-list govuk-list--bullet\">\n        <li>sciences - you could volunteer to lead your school or college science club or be a science ambassador</li>\n        <li>teaching - help at an after school club or in out of school activities like <a class=\"govuk-link\" href=\"https://www.girlguiding.org.uk/what-we-do/brownies-7-10/\">Brownies</a> and <a class=\"govuk-link\" href=\"https://www.scouts.org.uk/\">Scouts</a></li>\n        <li>media - try a communications role for a local charity or write a school or college blog</li>\n        <li>sports - help organise children’s sports teams</li>\n        <li>social care or mental health - be&nbsp;<a class=\"govuk-link\" href=\"https://www.ageuk.org.uk/get-involved/volunteer/local-services-volunteer/whats-it-like-to-be-an-age-uk-befriender/\">a befriender</a> to lonely and isolated elderly members of your\n            community\n        </li>\n    </ul>\n    <p class=\"govuk-body-m\">Remember, even if the role is not exactly what you want, it will still give you useful experience. It's about building skills for the future and being flexible in how you get them.</p>\n    <p class=\"govuk-body-m\">Research the sector you’re interested in and look for roles where you could develop your <a class=\"govuk-link\" href=\"/careers-advice/how-to-develop-your-soft-skills\">transferable skills</a>, like:</p>\n    <ul class=\"govuk-list govuk-list--bullet\">\n        <li>communication</li>\n        <li>public speaking</li>\n        <li>organisation</li>\n        <li>teamwork</li>\n        <li>fundraising</li>\n        <li>campaigning</li>\n        <li>admin</li>\n    </ul>\n</section>\n<p></p><hr class=\"govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--m govuk-section-break--visible\"><p></p>\n<section id=\"apply\">\n    <h2 class=\"govuk-heading-l\">How to apply for a volunteering position</h2>\n    <p class=\"govuk-body-m\">To apply for most volunteering positions, you will need an up-to-date <a class=\"govuk-link\" href=\"cv-sections\">CV</a> and a <a class=\"govuk-link\" href=\"/careers-advice/covering-letter/\">cover letter</a>.</p>\n    <p class=\"govuk-body-m\">Whether you apply for an advertised role or just approach organisations direct, you should be sure to show you are:</p>\n    <ul class=\"govuk-list govuk-list--bullet\">\n        <li>eager to help and put your skills to good use </li>\n        <li>hardworking, trustworthy and reliable</li>\n        <li>able to commit to the time the organisation needs</li>\n    </ul>\n</section>\n<p></p><hr class=\"govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--m govuk-section-break--visible\"><p></p>\n<section id=\"prepare\">\n    <h2 class=\"govuk-heading-l\">How to prepare and make a good impression</h2>\n    <p class=\"govuk-body-m\">Volunteering for the first time can be scary.
