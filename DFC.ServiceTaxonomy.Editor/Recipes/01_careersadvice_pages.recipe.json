Some include work placements. You may have the flexibility to tailor modules to fit your interests or career goals.</p>\n<p class=\"govuk-body-m\">On research degrees you work independently on a research topic, under an academic supervisor who guides you and helps you develop your investigative skills. You get to work with other research students and academic staff and have access to university\n    resources like labs and equipment.</p>\n<p class=\"govuk-body-m\">For both options there are opportunities to study full-time, part-time as well as through flexible and distance learning.

It’s a skill that can help you cope with all of life’s setbacks including those in your career. </p>\n<p class=\"govuk-body-m\">Being resilient will make sure that you are able to deal positively with challenging situations like:</p>\n<ul class=\"govuk-list govuk-list--bullet\">\n    <li>interview rejection </li>\n    <li>exam failure</li>\n    <li>redundancy</li>\n    <li>not getting a promotion</li>\n    <li>unexpected life events </li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"govuk-body-m\">Like all skills, resilience can be learned. With practice you can develop the thought processes and behaviours that make it possible to recover quickly or more easily adapt to change.</p>\n<nav>\n    <div class=\"govuk-grid-row\">\n        <div class=\"govuk-grid-column-full\">\n            <ul class=\"govuk-list govuk-list--bullet\">\n                <li><a class=\"govuk-link\" href=\"#resilience\">Build your resilience</a></li>\n                <li><a class=\"govuk-link\" href=\"#experiences\">Learn from your own experiences</a></li>\n                <li><a class=\"govuk-link\" href=\"#tips\">Tips to become more resilient</a></li>\n                <li><a class=\"govuk-link\" href=\"#resources\">Find resources and further help</a></li>\n            </ul>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</nav>\n<p></p><hr class=\"govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--m govuk-section-break--visible\"><p></p>\n<section id=\"resilience\">\n    <h2 class=\"govuk-heading-l\">Build your resilience</h2>\n    <p class=\"govuk-body-m\">There are some typical characteristics of truly resilient people. These include:</p>\n    <ul class=\"govuk-list govuk-list--bullet\">\n        <li>having a positive frame of mind and a willingness to try new things</li>\n        <li>being keen to meet new people and making them part of a support network of trusted friends and colleagues</li>\n        <li>knowing who to turn to and having the courage to ask for help and advice</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p class=\"govuk-body-m\">Trying to boost your resilience and build a support network can feel daunting. To help with this you could:</p>\n    <ul class=\"govuk-list govuk-list--bullet\">\n        <li>start a course - even online courses give you the chance to meet and chat with other learners</li>\n        <li>join a local or online interest group</li>\n        <li>take up a new hobby you can do with others</li>\n        <li>join a sports team or do something active </li>\n        <li>stay in regular contact with friends, family and work colleagues</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p class=\"govuk-body-m\">If you’re in school, college or university remember that there are professionals like teachers, mentors and careers advisers who can help you. </p>\n    <p class=\"govuk-body-m\">In the workplace you can draw on the support of a manager or get help from human resources professionals. </p>\n    <p class=\"govuk-body-m\">If you're out of work you could speak to a <a class=\"govuk-link\" href=\"https://gov.uk/moving-from-benefits-to-work\">Jobcentre work coach</a></p>\n</section>\n<p></p><hr class=\"govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--m govuk-section-break--visible\"><p></p>\n<section id=\"experiences\">\n    <h2 class=\"govuk-heading-l\">Learn from your own experiences</h2>\n    <p class=\"govuk-body-m\">When things don’t go as planned it can be a great learning opportunity. Use your past experience to identify ways of coping that worked for you in other situations. For example:</p>\n    <p class=\"govuk-body-m\">Think of a time when you:</p>\n    <ul class=\"govuk-list govuk-list--bullet\">\n        <li>achieved a goal - what were the steps that you went through and why did it turn out well?</li>\n        <li>had a setback that led to a change of plan – how did you feel? What did you do? If you were experiencing that now, what might you do differently?</li>\n        <li>asked for feedback from others – how did you respond? What did you do as a result?</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p class=\"govuk-body-m\">When thinking about these experiences try to:</p>\n    <ul class=\"govuk-list govuk-list--bullet\">\n        <li>focus on how you got there, rather than the end result - this will help you understand the right steps to take to be more adaptable in the future</li>\n        <li>explore your feelings to help you ‘reframe’ negative thoughts about a problem - this will help you to develop a more positive ‘can do’ attitude</li>\n        <li>think about how you react to and use criticism - this will help you to learn how to make the most of the advice others can give\n        </li>\n    </ul>\n    <hr class=\"govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--m govuk-section-break--visible\">\n    <section id=\"tips\">\n        <h2 class=\"govuk-heading-l\">Tips to become more resilient</h2>\n        <p class=\"govuk-body-m\">When things don’t go to plan try to:</p>\n        <ul class=\"govuk-list govuk-list--bullet\">\n            <li>make a list of all the times you have adapted well – remind yourself that you have coped before and you can do so again</li>\n            <li>see your experience as a chance to grow and improve</li>\n            <li>ask for constructive feedback – for example, after an interview, following an exam or a work appraisal</li>\n            <li>have a positive outlook – you may not be able to alter the situation but you can change the way you think about it </li>\n            <li>connect with others and ask for help </li>\n            <li>focus on the things you can change and accept those you cannot</li>\n            <li>set yourself small goals and celebrate your achievements as you go</li>\n            <li>be kind to yourself – not always succeeding is a part of life</li>\n            <li>reflect on your experience and try to learn from it – it will make you stronger in the long term</li>\n        </ul>\n    </section>\n    <hr class=\"govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--m govuk-section-break--visible\">\n    <section id=\"resources\">\n        <h2 class=\"govuk-heading-l\">Find resources and further help</h2>\n        <p class=\"govuk-body-m\">Find further help from organisations, like:</p>\n        <ul class=\"govuk-list govuk-list--bullet\">\n            <li>Mind: <a class=\"govuk-link\" href=\"https://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/types-of-mental-health-problems/stress/developing-resilience/#collapseb86ac\">How can I be more resilient?</a></li>\n            <li>Open University: <a class=\"govuk-link\" href=\"https://www.open.edu/openlearn/ocw/mod/oucontent/view.php?id=64961&amp;section=3\">Developing career resilience</a></li>\n            <li>FutureLearn: <a class=\"govuk-link\" href=\"https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/wellbeing-and-resilience-at-work\">Wellbeing and resilience at work</a></li>\n        </ul>\n    </section>\n</section>"
