#ToDo

* pre-populate custom graph sync settings to represent the real defaults
* add visualisation settings into read only set
* can't reset focus on a pagelocation, nor visualise it from the editor

* requirements prefix items have empty text

* visualiser: right click menu

* in the grand tradition of esco always having 1 exception to the rule, 'types of wood materials' is both a skill and knowledge
  (http://data.europa.eu/esco/skill/fb6f5f61-f3b8-40ba-8363-c8d762325ff7)
  guessing it shouldn't be a skill

* separate out / show as a deleted item in validate results wwhen a deleted item is validates and don't make into a link that goes nowhere

* use linkgenerator instead of hardcoding in visualiser and validate results, perhaps wrap in service

* enhanced error notifications: publish to slack channel?

* errors : make content item links that open in a new tab, so they don't lose the list of blockers
add time
instructions on what to do / contact someone from appsettings / update the following items

* view and visualise buttons have non-unique ids

* add visualiser settings page to admin menu for things such as global max depth setting etc

* need to test branch, not master!


* visualiser..

// settings min degrees, max degrees, max nodes
// 1st pass all relations/bags
// 2+ pass all relations/bags:
//   if node already encountered, add relationship, don't follow further
//   if content type already encountered, don't add node or relationship, don't follow further???
// if 2+ pass takes nodes past max nodes, don't add any of pass (will need to stage)
// ignore maxnodes for 1 degree??

will interact with webvowl doing something similar...
`The number of visualized elements has been automatically reduced.`


* should skill and occupation labels be creatable?

* section break's have broke - they look wrong in the html editor

* revisit recipes following idempotent recipes changes. create/import? create generates new ids(?) find different way to disable sync
see https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore/pull/5487
https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore/issues/1970

* check config asap at startup and check for presence of __placeholders__ (or missing/bad config in general) still in config

* move common field syncing such as modified/created/contentitemid to graphsyncpart?

* disable cloning taxonomies?? backdoor to creating a draft taxonomy (although it works, so perhaps we leave it)

* pass part instances to syncers, rather than jobjects??

* ensure all cypher queries and commands use parameters

* if sync fails and changes cancelled, leave user on edit page with their changes intact

* does oc taxonomy module have unit tests? if so bring them in

* add new module for events, sitting on top of sync, using the new events library

* Generate correlation Id in handler?

* if a shared content widget has no picked published content types, don't sync the html widget itself in the published graph set

* should we sync htmlshared widget in published if there are no published shared content items
the user can't have no shared content items picked, so the only time a widget with no shared content item relationships is synced is when a pub page references only draft items
so we should probably not sync 'empty' shared widgets

* why graph sync has tags in features, but others don't?

* contents of flow part widgets outside of the widgets (dom issue, not css)!

* replicate taxonomy fix: https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgxwJXLntMnZkqzJfcvWQKXsHKDGV

* need to resync following part deletion too

* notifier with dropdown containing technical details/exceptions?

* dev env is reporting its production
AspNetCoreEnvironment : Production

* sync contentitemid (& contentitemversion) into graphs?

* move page flow into own tab, so have Metadata, Content and SEO?

* wysiwyg alignment in flow part (if we need to support justification)

* MergeNodeCommand.AddProperty helpers need to call graphsynchelper PropertyName

* when deleting get this message..
The new Shared Content could not be removed because the associated node could not be deleted from the graph.
^ it should have a notification for each of published/preview

* pages : alias only has to be unique to location, not to page content type

* graphsync 2 settings, 1 for published 1 for preview?

* looks like we have an exemption from gds to be able to use different colours (see https://skillsfundingagency.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DFC/pages/1998946687/GDS+toolkit+flexibility+exemption+-+EW+JT)
   update html editor

* draft/pub
 query runner: pick draft/pub through ui?

* use graph clustering algorithms to pick out real user groupings, and potentially match then to personas (or discover new ones)

* check publish later actually publishes

* support custom part/field sync as part of a particular content type

* preview pages app could use the synced publish/unpublish later data to give the user a timeline control sto show a preview of the page at a particular point in time

* pages app

Add facility for displaying a content type (or a specific content item) within a section of a page
using a template created by the ux/ur/content users.

Also support output from a microservice app to be displayed in a page section (where the user can set properties for it in the editor).

A template for a content item could be unique to a page, or content items could have default layout/views that could be added within a section.
also possibly to support different common views for content items (widget with content).

Views/layouts could be built up hierarchically.

create content widget that has
Content type drop down
Content picker drop down, (or all)
bool item only/related hierarchy
Or all items, each item having a URLs canonical name specified through autoroute
(That way for example could construct occupations page
Find way to embed related content similar alto to visualiser
So could display eg Jp
Jp could have its own flow part for layout within its parent layout
So can display content at any point in the hierarchy)

Widget where select content type, and add canonical name for url (autoroute so can slugify display)
Then add button to HTML editor to add content item fields as a token/placeholder in the HTML, using liquid so can mutate field
will be able to access properties in item itself, or related items

widget for related content item??

widget version of current content item, with display type?

widget to inlude a (embedded )flow part for content item, related content with its own flow part can be included
widget that uses flow part of selected item, and/or widget that has html view as part of container
(allows reuse or unique view of content item(s))
both will use html editor with placeholder injection

App widget
(App pubs name and settings url and display url
Widget lookups name
Display settings
Send to display
Show display in widget)

Micro display app publishes event with name/url/(description etc?) - Editor goes to event store for previously published, then subscribes to get later pubs For advertised micro displays

app widget call url to get HTML form
Post back returns the display which show in flow
form can contain input type = content, which the widget uses to insert and allow selection of content item
settings are stored in graph
pages app when displaying the apps output will post it the saved settings from the graph

Micro display can ask for content items which it gets sent on post
,input type=content data-type etc

investigate existing widgets like validation/validation summary/form etc. can we sync and have pages app use?


* import util:
have flag as to whether to batch createasyncs (works in sqlite, not in sql azure)
generate 1 master recipe for env import with serial createasyncs
generate multiple masters for local, with async createasyncs

* split from 1 master recipe into many, so can be imported concurrently
  perhaps 1 each for...
  occupation, skills, jp & categories, everything else

* when in graph repair mode, handle the replacerelationshipscommand sanity check failures, so that they don't halt the repair process

* the build status badge is borked. add it back when it work (devops will probably need to fix)

* investigate option b for simpler validation query, or use new Subgraph??

Option A

easier to generate cypher (but relationships and nodes not labelled)

Option A would be better to create a hierarchy for validation and such like

Option B is probably beter for visualisation, as its what we massage the data into for the visualiser anyway

## Build Status

[![Build Status](https://sfa-gov-uk.visualstudio.com/Digital%20First%20Careers/_apis/build/status/Service%20Taxonomy/dfc-servicetaxonomy-editor?branchName=master)](https://sfa-gov-uk.visualstudio.com/Digital%20First%20Careers/_build/latest?definitionId=1923&branchName=master)

* use UserTask for button edition (replacement?) for our editor buttons, such as visualization

* content approval workflow : http://www.ideliverable.com/blog/orchard-core-workflows-walkthrough-content-approval

* difference between implementing graph validation as timed workflow vs background task

* add content in background task (see further discussion around this comment in gitter)
The content manager is scoped so to resolve it from a singleton (hopefully works in a background task this way) you'll want to get it from an http context IHttpContextAccessor.Context.RequestServices.GetService<IContentManager>()

* add setting to graph sync to set the node property name for titles

* content api whitelist relationships off esco occupation and skill

* remove html sanitizer settings
we should make sure front end and backend html sanitizers marry up
would be better to report when html has been sanitized, rather than silently doing it > dean said not possible

* there's a trumbowyg template plugin : do we have any templates?

* trumbowyg plugin

auto add class="govuk-body" to p's
^ looks like not supported in trumbowyg (see keyup focus). perhaps leave as is (maybe hack or replace trumbowyg js, but then a pain to maintain)

headings with captions??

if possible add span if selection part of an elements content
and add to existing element if selection is whole content of element

add spacing and width override buttons?

layout?? or leave to template page??

don't allow to change font

* trumbowyg insists on adding <p> and getting rid of new lines. can we set otherwise?

* Look into console error when selecting an item in a ContentPickerWithPreview control.

* GET https://localhost:5001/DFC.ServiceTaxonomy.Theme/Theme.png 404

customs-officer not found in the jp dictionary

store object of contentitemid and aggregate name as value

* add these to our theme?

    BaseTheme = "TheAdmin",
    Tags = new [] { "admin" }

* add major.minor version number to content item. major for published and minor for draft. then add that to the published event grid event

* importing now published draft-discarded as well as published

* check multi-topic config works

* add properties to csharpcontent: addtosessioncache

* enforce readonly nodes by not allowing user to delete the corresponding content item?

* make sure only 1 validate and repair is operating at once

* recommended connection string settingsL Maximum Pool Size=256;NoResetOnClose=true;Enlist=false;Max Auto Prepare=50

* we need to make sure we have decent views for content items, as when there is a draft and published version, you can only view the published version (and only see the draft in edit)

* api function
    load config into an optionsmonitor in a static field, getting the snapshot on each call, so that it should speed it up whilst also supporting changing the config without restarting the app service
    now that we output properties directly, remove ncs_ prefix from properties, and change skos__prefLabel to something a bit more meaningful. will have to update the existing apis too though
    also rename relationships for content api

* add support for searching within content items e.g. filter content items by uri (add lucene indexes for content items?)

* remove skip and take from importer

have single topic for all content types and have subscriber which sends data into app insights - if not already supported
see
https://github.com/microsoft/ApplicationInsights-dotnet/issues/1427
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58550335/application-insights-correlation-through-event-grid
here a function pipes it on to ai: https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-global/event-driven-serverless-apps-with-azure-event-grid-and-azure/ba-p/355634
is it possible to link them directly?
add workflow correlation id to message - try and tie in with ai and event correlationid, or use oc correlationid?

once we start having consumers - won't be able to just regenerate recipes and end up with different uri's for each content item

todo
    create/modified/deleted
    remove ncs__ prefix on properties (& rename skos__prefLabel? but then inconsistent with esco)

    do we want an event domain - publish to single endpoint and event contains topic as opposed to endpoint per topic?
    or could have a single topic for content (prob not??)
    how to keep aeg-sas-key header value secret? can liquid template pick up from config? no, nor javascript
    implement IGlobalMethodProvider to provide the value
    based on ConfigurationMethodProvider, but how to make available to workflow/liquid?
    think we'll need a canonicalname added to every content type
    or slugify title?
    title simpler, but means can't change title ever. might be best to have a canonical name, but how to get from eponymous part? new custom part?

inject the content type into the topic url - will have to set up more topic - do in dev if available

{{ Workflow.Input.ContentItem.ContentType }}
{{ Workflow.Input.ContentItem.Content.GraphSyncPart.Text }}
{{ Workflow.Input.ContentItem.Content.TitlePart.Title }}

topic per contenttype?
subject: do we have {canonicalName} or {contenttype}/{canonicalName}?
if we want the canonical name, might be difficult to get a canonicalname field from the eponymous part in liquid.
could either have a canonical part, or slugify the title (although how would that work with bag items with no title?)
{{ "This is some text" | slugify }}
{{ Workflow.Input.ContentItem.Content.TitlePart.Title | slugify}}

topic per contenttype, or single topic with content type in event?

id: do we put the uri in there, or just the guid? should we use it for the opaque uri or put in data?
we could probably get away without any user data

https://stax.eastus-1.eventgrid.azure.net/api/events?api-version=2018-01-01
https://stax-{{ Workflow.Input.ContentItem.ContentType }}.eastus-1.eventgrid.azure.net/api/events?api-version=2018-01-01

having subject as /contenttype/id
allows filtering by content type using subjectBeginsWith
and filtering by content can use either subjectBeginsWith or subjectEndsWith
do we want an initial /stax/ just in case there are other sources of content:eye?
max 5 advanced filters per subscription, so best to make the most of the standard properties

Publish Item Published Event

POST

[{
  "id": "{{ Workflow.CorrelationId }}",
  "eventType": "published-modified",
  "subject": "/content/{{ Workflow.Input.ContentItem.ContentType }}/{{ Workflow.Input.ContentItem.Content.GraphSyncPart.Text | slice: -36, 36 }}",

  },
  "dataVersion": "1.0"
}]

aeg-sas-key: {{ Workflow.Properties["aeg-sas-key"] | raw }}

200, 400, 401, 404, 413

date filter doesn't like %7N or similar, so we use %L for now which might cause issues as not fine grained enough, although event grid accepts the datetime
it's not supported: https://github.com/sebastienros/fluid/blob/dev/Fluid/Filters/MiscFilters.cs
we could use set property - js to set the time in the proper format
not sure if using ContentItemVersionId will give us dupes, if so use uuid instead

config(input('ContentItem') + '-aeg-sas-key')

* content picker preview : use {% layout "CustomLayout" %} rather than default theme layout, so can use default layout for admin pages??? https://docs.orchardcore.net/en/dev/docs/reference/modules/Liquid/
    back to jumping: fix

* change the importer config to have an array of settings and generate a set of recipes for each config

* contentpicker with preview:
    use bag open close control
    avoid initial ajax call if pre-populated
    add settings, edit button? start open etc.

/masterrecipes/full-no-mutators_xxx.recipe.json
/recipes/all the sub recipes (edited)
^ that way its easier to see and pick the master recipes
also don't add the guid to the master recipe filename

* shared content: how safe is it to allow users to create content with  urls/classes etc.
 \ will need devs to be able to change content, e.g. to change classes etc.

* Get help using this service : content has inline style and uses <br> for positioning

* when title is set to 'editable and required', hint is shown as 'The title of the content item. It will be automatically generated.'.
^ create oc pr?

* api: GetJobProfilesBySearchTerm should tolower the search term

* graph validator : group verified results in ui by content type
                    only ask for relationship types that we'll be checking for (would have to ask all parts/fields for relationships they care about)
                    log user id, not contentitemid

master recipe:
check import carries on ok after timeout
check zip => json doesn't cause issues
recipes in editor/recipes -> available in dev?
logging? (will slow down import though)

* create index recipe > if exists, drop, then create (or some other sequence that doesn't cause the master recipe to go boom)

* update import so only occupation labels that are required for the jp set are imported
* we should explicitly set (and check) required and multiple settings for all content pickers

* sync validation:
     safer to check all content items!?
     we could validate a content items parts concurrently to speed it up (ConcurrentDictionary for expectedRelationshipCounts at least)
     ^ we could report all validation errors, although not necessary, as if there's at least 1 error then we need to attempt a repair
     we could validate content items concurrently
* use migrations (that execute recipes) to update content types, once live (https://docs.orchardcore.net/en/dev/docs/reference/modules/Recipes/)
* remove content types from full text queries : speed up import?
* move visualiser overriden views into visualiser module (https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore/issues/5128)

* with preview packages:
bulk actions menu doesn't appear in MS Edge (breakpoints not hit), but works in chrome

* syncing (widget) content type with lots of different parts gave this error: Sync to graph failed: Index was outside the bounds of the array.

* implement [c#:] using this: https://docs.orchardcore.net/en/dev/docs/reference/modules/Scripting/

* make sure strings are localised
* composite part containing fields (collapsible)?
* need to stop user from adding another occupation to a jp
* set commands page size for batching creates?: https://github.com/sebastienros/yessql/pull/228/files
* new version of ContentManager.CreateAsync that takes collection contentitems?
* importing recipe, then unpublish content items, then reimport and sync doesn't happen
seems once you've imported a recipe, if you reimport the same one it doesn't trigger sync even if you unpublish or delete some items first
could fix when create new content recipe step
* change importer to set float (ie 123.0) values for numeric field to match orchard core
* change import to use md5 hash of content for id guid
* unit tests!!
* use custom command in integration test, so as not to arrange using code under test + add integration tests for new queries + integration tests at graph sync and validation levels
* in cyphertocontent step, improve parallelisation, work off ratio to cores? call back to speed up?
* titles (for picking) on esco skills??

* other requirements is in job profile content type as a html field -> think it should be a content picker
* some descriptions like SOCCode show <p></p>, others don't
* remove activites now we have daytodaytasks?
* use AddSetupFeatures to plug in one of the solutions from https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore/pull/4567 & auto sync at startup
* in graph lookup, handle situation (as with esco__nodeLiteral) where have 2 nodes, one with language en and 1 with language en-us, which causes duplicate entries
* need to add dependencies into manifest?
* graph lookup: use predefined list editor for node label?
* handle graph down/not running better (& quicker)
* looks like might be some useful code in the [client](https://github.com/Readify/Neo4jClient), e.g. working with results

* currently we don't properly recurse embedded items when removing a part that embeds other content items
  we should add proper support for removing a containing/embedding part...

  //todo: options:
  // A)
  // call sync skipping zombies
  // call delete excluding non-zombies
  // combine commands
  // execute commands
  // +ve
  // -ve e.g. contentpickerfield sync doesn't explicitly remove relationships, it relies on the outgoing relationships being deleted with the node
  // and as we wouldn't be deleting the node, we'd have to add relationship deletion to content picker, which it wouldn't need in a normal delete
  // B)
  // handle detachment explicitly
  // +ve some delete code e.g. contentpickerfield is not actually shared with the normal delete
  // -ve can't easily reuse delete code
  // embedded recursion for delete is gonna be a pain - either have to create a delete context and add that into the sync tree
  // or add a delete context to the mergecontext
  // but can't call delete embedded directly anyway as needs delete phase1 to have already happened
  // or use mergesync and pass flag to say actually deleting
  // do we _need_ full recursion?
  // don't think user can remove taxonomy part (just delete the taxonomy)
  // flow : at the moment only have html & htmlshared widget and deleting those (with outgoing relationships) would be ok
  // bag : does need proper recursion, but we don't use it atm

##ToDo UI Improvements

* don't like new disabled select appearing once selected in single select scenario - nasty!
* provide error/warning to use if they try to add a tab and an accordion to the same part - it isn't supported!

#Workflow Event Triggering

##Contents/ContentItem page
| When ContentItem is  | Publishing triggers      |
|----------------------|--------------------------|
| not published        | contentudpate & publish  |
| published            | contentudpate & publish  |

##Contents/ContentItems page

| published            | n/a                      |



each event comes through as a separate workflow instance. can we 'collate' them into single task call?
or do we publish multiple events?
versioning: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60308183/orchard-core-cms-content-versioning-scheduling-and-audit-trail
ContentItemVersionId is null for new > safe draft!
add workflow id?

notes:
1 doesn't seem to be a way to distinguish between updated event when validation fails and when it doesn't (except it's followed by a created event when it succeeds)
2 no uniqueness on single workflow, unique if we we collate events for action, but how do we do that - contentitemversionis isn't static throughout event sequence. each event is in different workflow

options for new-draft new-published uniqueness
timer delay, fetch item, check status
cache created event, if publish event comes in after new-publish, else timeouts new-draft
hook into publish/save draft and add status in custom part? either through replacing button, or wrapping contentmanager?

how to handle items that fail validation?
what if we just published published / draft and dropped new/updated

the api atm just has a way of fetching a content item. it needs to distinguish between draft/published (once its supported in the graph)

on updated, trigger timer to allow user action to complete. get current status of item, if created since timer trigger time, new, then if published new publish, if not new draft.
else if updated since trigger time, updated, but how to tell draft or published? will have to test
use task.delay? will that have the right context?
use a repeating workflow timer event - would have to save update events, and if the event time was too soon ago, leave it there for the next trigger
use signalling?
HttpWorkflowController Trigger has the code for continuing workflows waiting on a signal - we could have a workflow that gets triggered by a signal

or new button to new controller, pass to existing controller and publish event according to what user has done?

or add trigger to neo that published the event?

todo: add validated as column

#Notes

##Occupation

basic liquid templates

Content_Summary__Occupation
{{ Model.ContentItem | display_text }}



Content__Occupation
{% assign preferred_labels = Model.ContentItem.Content.Occupation.PreferredLabel.ContentItemIds | content_item_id %}
User preferred Label (use bootstrap disabled field for display?)
{{ preferred_labels.first | display_text }}
{% assign alternative_labels = Model.ContentItem.Content.Occupation.AlternativeLabels.ContentItemIds | content_item_id %}
Alternative labels
{% for alternative_label in alternative_labels %}
{{ alternative_label | display_text }}
{% endfor %}

we could leave the preferred title out of the occupation preview, but (for now at least) the title is the original esco prefLabel, and the prefLabel content picker is the user selected new prefLabel, so leave the picked pref label in

we have code to display the label of the preflabel content picker in the contentpicker list, and we could make occupation not listable (so the poor displaytext is not seen), but the content picker search is still on the displaytext (title), not the preflabel picker, even though that is the value that's displayed

#Label improvements

##PrefLabel
For an occupation’s prefLabel, we could use

```
match (:esco__Occupation)-[:skosxl__prefLabel]->(pl:skosxl__Label)
return pl.skosxl__literalForm
```
although we couldn’t use the current Title part. We could have the label as an ordinary field and change the config on the content picker preview field in job profile.

However there are other (roughly 30) skosxl__Label nodes off each occupation related by skosxl__prefLabel, that are mostly junk. Apart from id and uri, the only property they contain is esco__hasLabelRole and the node set contains 1 or 2 separate values and there are no other relationships from/to the nodes. The value set is

```
"http://data.europa.eu/esco/label-role/neutral"
"http://data.europa.eu/esco/label-role/standard-male"
"http://data.europa.eu/esco/label-role/female"
"http://data.europa.eu/esco/label-role/male"
```
It may be, that although we filter by “en” language, we still get a set of 1 or 2 nodes for each language.

We could remove all the extra nodes after import, either all of them, or leave 1 each for each distinct label role, in case we want to know the gender of the label at some point.

##AltLabel
AltLabel is similar to prefLabel, in that there are nodes that follow the same pattern. The difference with altLabel, is that because the gender nodes are only related to the occupation and not the label node (same as prefLabel), the gender nodes are useless as there’s no means to link the gender role to a particular label. (As there is only 1 prefLabel node, the gender nodes, although not related to the label node, is obviously for the single prefLabel.)

##Skills of type used by JP

match (jp:JobProfile)-[ro:relatedOccupation]-(o:esco__Occupation)-[rs:esco__relatedOptionalSkill|esco__relatedEssentialSkill]-(s)-[rst:esco__skillType]-(st) where st.skos__prefLabel = 'skill' return count(distinct s)

##Testing graph validation

###Test text field incorrect

```match (n:ncs__JobProfile) where n.skos__prefLabel = 'MP' set n.ncs__WorkingPatternDetails='new' return n```

###Test content picker missing relationship

View:

```match (o:esco__Occupation)-[r:ncs__hasAltLabel]->(d {skos__prefLabel:'assembly member'}) where o.skos__prefLabel='member of parliament' return o, r, d```

Remove expected relationship:

```match (o:esco__Occupation)-[r:ncs__hasAltLabel]->(d {skos__prefLabel:'assembly member'}) where o.skos__prefLabel='member of parliament' delete r```

#Workflows

Here are some useful workflows:

## Workflow triggered by all content events, adds trigger type to "Trigger" property and calls task

## EventGridClient vs custom

// using EventGridClient vs HttpRestClient
// EventGridClient has lots of extras
// e.g. sets x-ms-client-request-id as new guid (can't supply own) - what exactly is it? looks network related as opposed to correlation id
// topicHostname gets passed to PublishEventsAsync. presumably that means needs to open a socket connection each time an event is published
// and lose out on kept alive connections and the goodness you get using IHttpClientFactory
// see, https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/microservices/implement-resilient-applications/use-httpclientfactory-to-implement-resilient-http-requests
// EventGridClient and EventGridEvent use old newtonsoft.json, rather than System.Net.Http
// EventGridViewer: get updates for free
// https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/tree/fef6a5436167758454a9eb965ed1d7b3f8eb061b/sdk/eventgrid/Microsoft.Azure.EventGrid
