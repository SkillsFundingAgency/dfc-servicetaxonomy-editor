## Developer Notes
A recipe **ft2-82-content-approval-module.recipe.json** has been created to enable this feature and generate the required roles to support the workflow.
This should be merged into the main Service Taxonomy recipe before this is pulled into live.

can we use Securable to control visibility to different roles??

todo query items and link to bring up content items page with filter pre-selected

todo initially bring up dashboard rather than welcome message

permission to view cards? don't think so

try and extend funnel rather than adding new custom filter

deleting dashboard widgets doesn't seem to work
we probably want to hide the edit and delete for our widgets anyway
