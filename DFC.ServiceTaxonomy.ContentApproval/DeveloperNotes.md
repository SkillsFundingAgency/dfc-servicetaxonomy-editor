## Developer Notes
A recipe **ft2-82-content-approval-module.recipe.json** has been created to enable this feature and generate the required roles to support the workflow.
This should be merged into the main Service Taxonomy recipe before this is pulled into live.

todo: enabling the 2 required features manually works
but importing the recipe that enables the 2 features doesn't set up the modules (migrations) correctly for some reason

can we use Securable to control visibility to different roles??

content item per approval card type : dropdown to select type?
^^ widget per hard gives a better ui experience

todo query items and link to bring up content items page with filter pre-selected

todo initially bring up dashboard rather than welcome message

permission to view cards? don't think so

try and extend funnel rather than adding new custom filter
