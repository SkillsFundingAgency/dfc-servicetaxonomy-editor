## Developer Notes
A recipe **ft2-82-content-approval-module.recipe.json** has been created to enable this feature and generate the required roles to support the workflow.
This should be merged into the main Service Taxonomy recipe before this is pulled into live.

^^^ can we include the recipe in the module and run it in Migrations?
would probably need to split feature enabling from everything else

can we use Securable to control visibility to different roles??

content item per approval card type : dropdown to select type?
